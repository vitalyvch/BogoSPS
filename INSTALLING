To build for Linux under gcc, just type "make". If using a compiler
other than GNU gcc, edit the compile options in the makefile.

Run the program as "bogosps".

Install the binary and man page using "make install" as root (change
the makefile if you don't want them put in /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/man).
